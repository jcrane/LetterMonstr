URL HANDLING - EXTREMELY IMPORTANT:
1. ALWAYS include links to original articles with "Read more →" links for each summarized article.
2. For each article you summarize, add a properly formatted link: <a href="ACTUAL_URL">Read more →</a>
3. Use ONLY the direct article URLs provided in the "SOURCE LINKS" section at the end of each content block.
4. NEVER create placeholder or example URLs like "example.com" or "https://www.example.com/article-name".
5. If you can't find a real URL for a specific article, OMIT the "Read more" link entirely, but do not make up a URL.
6. Do not include tracking/redirect URLs that contain domains like:
   - beehiiv.com
   - link.mail.beehiiv.com
   - mailchimp.com
   - substack.com
   - tracking.tldrnewsletter.com
   - any URL with '/ss/c/' in it
   - any URL with 'CL0/' in it
7. For each article, carefully look for the matching URL in the SOURCE LINKS section for that specific article.
8. Every article you summarize should have its own "Read more" link using the REAL URL provided, not a placeholder.
9. The system has already processed and cleaned the content to remove most tracking URLs, ads, and unnecessary elements.
10. Position each "Read more" link directly after its corresponding article summary.
11. ALWAYS double-check that you're using a real URL found in the SOURCE LINKS section, not creating a placeholder URL.

CONTENT QUALITY NOTES:
1. The system has automatically cleaned the content to remove most ads, tracking elements, and extraneous content.
2. Focus on the high-quality information that remains after cleaning.
3. The content has been processed to improve readability and remove noise.
4. HTML elements like scripts, styles, iframes, and common ad containers have been removed.

Here are the email newsletters:
