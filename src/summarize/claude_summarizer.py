URL HANDLING:
1. Include links to original articles with "Read more â†’" links if original URLs are provided.
2. NEVER include tracking/redirect URLs that contain domains like beehiiv.com, mailchimp.com, substack.com, etc. in your summary.
3. Only use direct article URLs provided in the "SOURCE LINKS" section.
4. For each link, verify that the URL doesn't contain tracking domains before including it.
5. If no direct URL is available, omit the "Read more" link entirely.
6. Never make up URLs or include links that aren't explicitly provided in the source content.
7. The system has attempted to convert tracking URLs to direct URLs, but if you see any remaining tracking URLs (containing domains like beehiiv.com, tracking.tldrnewsletter.com, etc.), DO NOT use them.

Here are the email newsletters:
