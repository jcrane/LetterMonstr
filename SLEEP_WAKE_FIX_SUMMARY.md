# Sleep/Wake Fix Summary

## Problem

LetterMonster was not properly resuming after laptop sleep, requiring manual intervention to stop and restart the application.

## Solution Implemented

A comprehensive multi-layered approach to handle laptop sleep/wake cycles:

### 1. Enhanced Sleep Detection

- **Faster detection**: Reduced threshold from 5 minutes to 3 minutes
- **Better logging**: Clear visual indicators with emojis for easy log reading
- **Accurate tracking**: Monitors time gaps and reports missed scheduled runs

### 2. Network Readiness Validation

- **Wait for network**: System waits up to 30 seconds for network to be ready
- **DNS testing**: Validates network by resolving `gmail.com`
- **Stabilization period**: Additional 5-second wait after network is ready
- **Graceful skip**: If network isn't ready, skips the cycle and tries again later

### 3. Connection Health Checks

- **Pre-flight validation**: Validates all connections before running tasks
- **IMAP connection testing**: Tests Gmail IMAP connection before fetching
- **Automatic reconnection**: Stale connections are automatically replaced
- **Enhanced timeouts**: Increased IMAP timeout to 30 seconds

### 4. Improved Error Handling

- **Exponential backoff**: Retry delays increase progressively (5s, 7.5s, 11.25s...)
- **Consecutive error tracking**: Monitors error patterns to detect serious issues
- **Graceful degradation**: System continues operation even if some cycles fail
- **Better exception handling**: Catches socket errors, timeouts, and IMAP aborts

### 5. Scheduler Recovery

- **Complete reset**: Clears and recreates scheduler after sleep detection
- **Immediate catch-up**: Runs missed tasks immediately after wake
- **Job re-registration**: Ensures all scheduled jobs are properly set up
- **State persistence**: Maintains configuration across wake cycles

### 6. Optional LaunchAgent Service

- **Automatic restart**: macOS restarts the process if it crashes
- **Network-aware**: Configured to respond to network state changes
- **Persistent operation**: Survives logout, reboot, and system updates
- **Resource friendly**: Runs with lower priority to avoid system slowdown

## Files Modified

### Core Application Files

1. **`src/periodic_runner.py`**
   - Added `check_network_ready()` function
   - Enhanced `setup_scheduler()` with better sleep detection
   - Added `validate_connections_ready()` function
   - Improved error handling and logging

2. **`src/mail_handling/fetcher.py`**
   - Enhanced `connect()` with better retry logic and exponential backoff
   - Improved `check_connection()` to detect and handle stale connections
   - Added longer timeouts (30s) for IMAP connections
   - Better handling of socket errors and timeouts

### New Files Created

1. **`com.lettermonster.periodic.plist`**
   - macOS LaunchAgent configuration
   - Auto-restart on crash
   - Network state awareness

2. **`install_service.sh`**
   - One-command installation of LaunchAgent service

3. **`uninstall_service.sh`**
   - Clean removal of LaunchAgent service

4. **`restart_service.sh`**
   - Quick restart command for the service

5. **`test_sleep_recovery.sh`**
   - Diagnostic script to verify sleep/wake handling

6. **`SLEEP_WAKE_HANDLING.md`**
   - Comprehensive documentation of the feature
   - Installation and usage instructions
   - Troubleshooting guide

7. **`SLEEP_WAKE_FIX_SUMMARY.md`** (this file)
   - Technical summary of changes

### Documentation Updated

1. **`README.md`**
   - Added sleep/wake handling to features list
   - Added LaunchAgent service commands
   - Added reference to detailed documentation

## Testing the Fix

### Manual Test

1. Start LetterMonster (with or without LaunchAgent)
2. Let it run for 1-2 minutes (you'll see normal operation logs)
3. Put your laptop to sleep for 5+ minutes
4. Wake your laptop
5. Check logs: `tail -f data/lettermonstr_periodic.log`

### Expected Log Output After Wake

```log
‚ö†Ô∏è  SLEEP DETECTED: XXX seconds (X.X minutes) since last check
Waiting for network to be ready after wake...
Network is ready
Network ready, waiting 5 seconds for system to stabilize...
üîÑ Running recovery tasks after wake...
Cleared old scheduler jobs
‚úì Re-scheduled fetch and process to run every hour
‚úì Re-scheduled summary check to run every 15 minutes
üìä Estimated missed runs during sleep: X fetch runs, X summary checks
üöÄ Running catch-up tasks after sleep...
‚úì Catch-up tasks completed successfully
‚úì Sleep recovery completed
```

### Diagnostic Script

Run the test script to check for sleep/wake events:

```bash
./test_sleep_recovery.sh
```

## Recommendations

### For Best Results

**Install as a LaunchAgent service** - This provides the most robust solution:

```bash
./install_service.sh
```

Benefits:

- Automatic restart on crash
- Starts on login
- Network-aware operation
- Proper system integration

### Alternative Approaches

If you prefer not to use LaunchAgent:

- **Background running**: `nohup python3 src/periodic_runner.py &`
- **Manual running**: Start it when needed

The sleep detection will work with any method, but LaunchAgent provides the best overall experience.

## What Changed Under the Hood

### Connection Management

- **Before**: Connections were reused without validation, becoming stale after sleep
- **After**: Connections are validated before use and automatically refreshed

### Network Handling

- **Before**: Assumed network was always available
- **After**: Waits for network readiness and validates DNS before proceeding

### Error Recovery

- **Before**: Single retry attempt with fixed delays
- **After**: Multiple retries with exponential backoff and better error classification

### Sleep Detection

- **Before**: 5-minute threshold, basic recovery
- **After**: 3-minute threshold, comprehensive recovery with network validation

### Logging

- **Before**: Standard text logging
- **After**: Enhanced logging with visual indicators (emojis) for key events

## Backwards Compatibility

All changes are backwards compatible:

- Existing configurations work without modification
- The application can still run manually if preferred
- No database schema changes required
- All existing scripts still work

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for consideration:

- Configurable sleep detection threshold
- Health check endpoint for monitoring
- Metrics collection for sleep/wake events
- Email notifications for extended failures

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check logs: `tail -f data/lettermonstr_periodic.log`
2. Run diagnostics: `./test_sleep_recovery.sh`
3. Verify service status: `launchctl list | grep lettermonster`
4. Review detailed documentation: See `SLEEP_WAKE_HANDLING.md`
